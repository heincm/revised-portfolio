                            <p> Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.</p>

                            <p>I'm originally from a small town of about 2,500 people in rural Nebraska. I went to school at
                            the University of Nebraska at Kearney (Go Lopes) where I graduated in 2009 with a double major
                            in psychology and sociology. In 2011 I completed my masterâ€™s degree and graduated with a M.S.Ed.
                            in Student Affairs.
                            </p>

                            <p>I moved to Platteville, Wisconsin for three years where I worked as a professional Residence
                            Hall Director. In this role I gained my first hands-on experience working with frontend web development when I helped
                            migrate our departmental website through changes to two different content management systems.
                            </p>

                            <p>In 2014 I moved to Atlanta and began working at Georgia State University as an Academic
                            Counselor. In the summer of 2018 I took a 6 week course at GSU to learn how to pull data
                            reports from Oracle PL/SQL.
                            </p>

                            <p>In the fall of 2018 I enrolled in the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp, a 24 week full-stack
                            development program. To see some of the technologies I've learned and become familiar with,

                            </p>

                            <p>I am actively seeking employment as a web developer and am open to work in most any inudstry
                            in the Atlanta metro area. You can see some of my development projects
